<p>There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; 
and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. 
The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which 
was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.</p>

whether it was good manners for her to speak first, <q>why your cat grins like that?</q></p>
