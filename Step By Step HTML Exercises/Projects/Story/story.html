<h1>Chapter I</h1>
<h2>Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>
</header>

<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped
into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations
in it, &lsquo;and what is the use of a book,&rsquo; thought Alice &lsquo;without 
pictures or conversation?&rsquo;</p>

<p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she
could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the
pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by
her.</p>

<p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did
Alice think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 
&lsquo;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!&rsquo; (when she thought it over 
afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but 
at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually <em>took a 
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice 
started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before 
seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and 
burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was 
just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>

<p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once
considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>

<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some
way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to
think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
well.</p>

<p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly,
for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder
what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what
she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the
sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and
book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took
down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled &lsquo;<em>orange 
marmalade</em>&rsquo;, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to
drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the
cupboards as she fell past it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; thought Alice to herself, &lsquo;after such a fall as
this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they&rsquo;ll all
think me at home! Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
top of the house!&rsquo; (Which was very likely true.)</p>

<p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <em>never</em> come to an end! &lsquo;I
wonder how many miles I&rsquo;ve fallen by this time?&rsquo; she said aloud. &lsquo;I must be
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
thousand miles down, I think&#8212;&lsquo; (for, you see, Alice had learnt several
things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a
<em>very</em> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to
listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) &lsquo;&#8212;yes, that&rsquo;s
about the right distance&#8212;but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I&rsquo;ve
got to?&rsquo; (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought
they were nice grand words to say.)</p>

<p>Presently she began again. &lsquo;I wonder if I shall fall right
<em>through</em> the earth! How funny it&rsquo;ll seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think&#8212;&lsquo; (she was rather
glad there <em>was</em> no one listening, this time, as it didn&rsquo;t sound at all the right
word) &lsquo;&#8212;but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you
know. Please, Ma&rsquo;am, is this New Zealand or Australia?&rsquo; (and she tried to
curtsey as she spoke&#8212;fancy <em>curtseying</em> as you&rsquo;re falling through the air!
Do you think you could manage it?) &lsquo;And what an ignorant little girl she&rsquo;ll
think me for asking! No, it&rsquo;ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written
up somewhere.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice
soon began talking again. &lsquo;Dinah&rsquo;ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!&rsquo;
(Dinah was the cat.) &lsquo;I hope they&rsquo;ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time.
Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air,
I&rsquo;m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that&rsquo;s very like a mouse, you know.
But do cats eat bats, I wonder?&rsquo; And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and
went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, &lsquo;Do cats eat bats? Do cats
eat bats?&rsquo; and sometimes, &lsquo;Do bats eat cats?&rsquo; for, you see, as she couldn&rsquo;t
answer either question, it didn&rsquo;t much matter which way she put it. She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand
in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, &lsquo;Now, Dinah, tell me the
truth: did you ever eat a bat?&rsquo; when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>

<p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet
in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was
another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was
just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, &lsquo;Oh my ears and whiskers,
how late it&rsquo;s getting!&rsquo; She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but
the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall,
which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p>

<p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all
locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other,
trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever
to get out again.</p>

<p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all
made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice&rsquo;s
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but,
alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any
rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came
upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door
about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to
her great delight it fitted!</p>

<p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small
passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of
that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those
cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; &lsquo;and
even if my head would go through,&rsquo; thought poor Alice, &lsquo;it would be of very
little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a
telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.&rsquo; For, you see, so many
out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that
very few things indeed were really impossible.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door,
so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or
at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time
she found a little bottle on it, (&lsquo;which certainly was not here before,&rsquo; said
Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words &lsquo;<em>drink</em>
ME&rsquo; beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p>

<p>It was all very well to say &lsquo;Drink me,&rsquo; but the wise
little Alice was not going to do <em>that</em> in a hurry. &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll look first,&rsquo; she
said, &lsquo;and see whether it&rsquo;s marked &ldquo;poison&rdquo; or not&rsquo;; for she had read several
nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild
beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they <em>would</em> not remember the
simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will
burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger <em>very</em> deeply
with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink
much from a bottle marked &lsquo;poison,&rsquo; it is almost certain to disagree with you,
sooner or later.</p>

<p>However, this bottle was <em>not</em> marked &lsquo;poison,&rsquo; so Alice
ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of
mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.</p>
